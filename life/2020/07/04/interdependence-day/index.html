        <p>On this day, so many years ago,<br />
our forefathers declared our independence,<br />
so we would be free from foreign rule,<br />
free to pursue our own destiny<br />
as a nation, as a people.</p>

<p>And yet, too many of us were NOT free,<br />
shackled to the land by land owners <br />
to whom they were mere property, <br />
stripped of their own inalienable rights<br />
to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p>

<p>And to this day, those rights are only distant dreams<br />
to all too many of us, as we struggle under the yoke <br />
of a myriad of inequalities.</p>

<p>So I ask myself, on this day, if each of us are truly free,<br />
to enjoy our independence on equal ground<br />
with ALL of our brothers and sisters,<br />
or if our independence is just  a happy myth,<br />
that does not describe the world we actually live in.</p>

<p>Freedom is a beautiful dream, one still worth striving for,<br />
despite a million harsh realities that seem to stand in our way.</p>

<p>So perhaps each one of us must first embrace the truth <br />
that we are NOT independent, <br />
that we are bound by a million forces <br />
that limit us as individuals, <br />
but also connect us as a human family.</p>

<p>And there is a deeper truth, that we are INTERDEPENDENT,<br />
that we must achieve freedom for ALL of us,<br />
before any of us are truly free.</p>
