There will come a time
when memory foam forgets,
and Eveready 
isn’t ready.

These are the moments 
that remind us 
that our world is run
by the engine of entropy,
and that things wind down,
by and by.

All our expectations 
are but wistful dreams,
destined to dissolve
in the light of day,
when we are given glimpses 
of the divine cycle
of becoming and decay,
granting life to everything
in its time.
